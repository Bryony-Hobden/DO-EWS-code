# DO-EWS-code
MATLAB code for paper 'Early Warning Signals for abrupt shifts: a multiscale model for Dansgaard-Oeschger events'
Runme contains code required to output DO simulations over the last glacial period, including phase portraits. 
NGRIP.csv is the NGRIP 20 year mean data over the last 120,000 years, and pdfs.mat are the pdfs from the KDE used for the speed sampling.
H,K,rhs, sample, and theta are all used with DO_solve_IE.
bry_func and ews_func are used for the EWS analysis.
